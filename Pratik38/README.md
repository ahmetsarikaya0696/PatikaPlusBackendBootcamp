# Pratik38 Library Management System

This project is a simple library management system that demonstrates the relationship between authors and their books using C#. 

## Overview

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Yazar.cs**: This file defines the `Yazar` class, which represents an author with properties for `AuthorId` and `Name`.

2. **Kitap.cs**: This file defines the `Kitap` class, which represents a book with properties for `BookId`, `Title`, and `AuthorId`.

3. **Program.cs**: This file contains the main logic of the application, where a list of authors and books is created, and a join operation is performed to display the authors along with their respective books.
