# odev10.sql

This SQL script contains queries that operate on two tables: `actor` and `customer`. The primary focus is on the `first_name` column in both tables. Below are the functionalities implemented in the script:

## Queries

1. **Union of First Names**  
   This query retrieves all unique first names from both the `customer` and `actor` tables.
2. **Intersection of First Names**  
   This query finds the common first names that exist in both the `customer` and `actor` tables.
3. **Difference of First Names**  
   This query lists the first names that are present in the `actor` table but not in the `customer` table.

## Usage

To execute the queries, run the script in an SQL environment connected to a database containing the `actor` and `customer` tables.
