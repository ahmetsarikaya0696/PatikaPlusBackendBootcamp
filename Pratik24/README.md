# DVD Rental Project 2

## Overview
This project contains SQL scripts for managing a DVD rental database. The scripts include queries to retrieve data from various tables such as `film` and `actor`.

## SQL Scripts

### 1. Film Table Query
Retrieve all records from the `film` table where the `replacement_cost` is between 12.99 and 16.99.
### 2. Actor Table Query
Retrieve the `first_name` and `last_name` from the `actor` table for actors with the first names 'Penelope', 'Nick', or 'Ed'.
### 3. Film Rental Rate and Replacement Cost Query
Retrieve all records from the `film` table where the `rental_rate` is either 0.99, 2.99, or 4.99 and the `replacement_cost` is either 12.99, 15.99, or 28.99.
## Usage
Run the SQL scripts in a compatible database management system to interact with the DVD rental database.
