# Pratik39 Student Management System

## Overview
This project is a simple student management system that allows for the organization of students into classes. It demonstrates the use of basic object-oriented programming principles in C#.

## Classes

### Class
The `Class` class represents a course that students can enroll in. It contains the following properties:
- `ClassId`: An integer representing the unique identifier for the class.
- `ClassName`: A string representing the name of the class.
### Student
The `Student` class represents a student enrolled in a class. It contains the following properties:
- `StudentId`: An integer representing the unique identifier for the student.
- `StudentName`: A string representing the name of the student.
- `ClassId`: An integer representing the identifier of the class the student is enrolled in.
## Program
The `Program` class contains the main logic for grouping students by their respective classes and displaying the results. It initializes a list of classes and students, groups the students by class name, and prints the output to the console.
## Conclusion
This project serves as a foundational example of how to manage students and classes using C#. It can be expanded with additional features such as adding, removing, or updating students and classes.
